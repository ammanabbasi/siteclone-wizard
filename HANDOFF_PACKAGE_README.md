```bash
# Quick start commands
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000
```

#### 2. Code Quality Improvements (Week 1)
- Replace console.log with proper logging (winston/pino)
- Fix TypeScript 'any' types with proper interfaces
- Standardize error response formats

#### 3. Testing Enhancement (Week 2)
- Implement Jest unit tests
- Expand Playwright E2E coverage
- Add API integration tests

#### 4. Production Preparation (Week 3-4)
- Add authentication system
- Implement rate limiting
- Set up monitoring and alerts
- Configure CI/CD pipeline

## üìä Project Metrics

### Codebase Overview
- **Total Files:** ~50 source files
- **Lines of Code:** ~5,000+ (estimated)
- **API Endpoints:** 8 main endpoints
- **React Components:** 5+ components
- **Core Libraries:** 12 main modules

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18.3.1, Next.js 14.2.22
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.8.3
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 3.4.1
- **Package Manager:** pnpm
- **Web Scraping:** Puppeteer 21.11.0
- **HTML Parsing:** Cheerio 1.0.0-rc.12

## üîê Security & Compliance

### Current Security Measures
- Content sanitization (removes sensitive data)
- Disabled external links in generated sites
- CORS configuration
- Input validation (basic)

### Security Roadmap
- [ ] Add authentication system
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Enhanced input validation
- [ ] Security headers (CSP, HSTS)
- [ ] Regular security audits

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Current Performance
- Handles most websites efficiently
- Memory usage optimized for single requests
- Browser instances managed per request

### Optimization Opportunities
- Browser instance pooling
- Caching layer for repeated requests
- Streaming for large file operations
- Worker threads for heavy processing

## ü§ù Knowledge Transfer

### Critical Knowledge Areas

#### 1. Core Flow Understanding
```
URL ‚Üí Scraper ‚Üí Parser ‚Üí Sanitizer ‚Üí Generator ‚Üí Next.js Project
```

#### 2. Key Files to Master
- `src/lib/scraper.ts` - Web scraping entry point
- `src/lib/parser.ts` - HTML parsing logic
- `src/lib/generator.ts` - Next.js project generation
- `src/app/api/clone/route.ts` - Main API endpoint

#### 3. Common Issues & Solutions
- **Puppeteer timeouts:** Increase timeout, add retry logic
- **Memory issues:** Proper cleanup, streaming for large files
- **CSS preservation:** Asset downloading and path resolution

### Development Patterns
- Consistent error handling with try-catch
- TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Async/await for all asynchronous operations
- Modular architecture with clear separation

## üìû Support Structure
